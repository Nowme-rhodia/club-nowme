  # SchÃ©ma initial pour la gestion des offres

  1. New Tables
    - `partners`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `user_id` (uuid, foreign key to auth.users)
      - `business_name` (text)
      - `contact_name` (text)
      - `phone` (text)
      - `website` (text)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
      - `updated_at` (timestamp)
    
    - `offers`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `partner_id` (uuid, foreign key to partners)
      - `title` (text)
      - `description` (text)
      - `category_slug` (text)
      - `subcategory_slug` (text)
      - `location` (text)
      - `coordinates` (point)
      - `status` (enum: draft, pending, approved, rejected)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
      - `updated_at` (timestamp)
    
    - `offer_prices`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `offer_id` (uuid, foreign key to offers)
      - `name` (text)
      - `price` (numeric)
      - `promo_price` (numeric)
      - `duration` (text)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
    
    - `offer_media`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `offer_id` (uuid, foreign key to offers)
      - `url` (text)
      - `type` (enum: image, video)
      - `order` (integer)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on all tables
    - Add policies for partners to manage their own data
    - Add policies for admins to manage all data
